                The video game industry has experienced tremendous growth over the past few decades, 
                evolving from simple 8-bit entertainment into a global market worth billions of dollars. 
                With advancements in technology, storytelling, and graphics, video games have become one 
                of the most influential forms of modern media<sup>1</sup>.

                This project examines the relationship between video game sales and their corresponding 
                Metacritic scores. Understanding how review scores correlate with commercial success may 
                provide insights for developers, publishers, and marketers seeking to optimize product 
                performance in an increasingly competitive marketplace<sub>2</sub>.
